Description: The level-dependent cross-validation method is implemented
        for the selection of thresholding
        value in wavelet shrinkage. This procedure is implemented
        by coupling a conventional cross validation with an
        imputation method due to a limitation of data length,
        a power of 2. It can be easily applied to classical
        leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation.
        Since the procedure is computationally fast,
        a level-dependent cross validation can be performed for
        wavelet shrinkage of various data such as a data
        with correlated errors.
